# Biomedical Image Segmentation &mdash; U-Net

Useful documentation is provided inside the notebook itself.
Achieved an accuracy of 96.8% on training data after having applied data augmentation.

### About Keras

Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. It allows quick experimentation and is not as complicated as Tensorflow itself.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

<ul>
  <li>Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through total modularity, minimalism, and extensibility)</li>
  <li>Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two</li>
  <li>Supports arbitrary connectivity schemes (including multi-input and multi-output training)</li>
  <li>Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.</li>
</ul>

Keras is compatible with Python 3.6+ and is distributed under the MIT license.
